My project so far made in huge part thanks to Coding With Adam.
The Space invaders game itself is all thanks to the code along.

With the help of videos on youtube I have added extra functionality to try and familiarize myself with
editing and altering code that isn't my own and really just understanding it. 

With the help of David Reid videos on youtube I added a start button.
I also added a 'How to Play' button and created my own graphic for that.

Listed below are the resources that I used as a core research tool, but I was also looking through
javamdn, w3schools, stackoverflow and other places just to look at documentation on issues.

With 20 more hours I would most definitely try adding a new enemy type or work with local storage to display
a high-score board.
