My project so far made in huge part thanks to Coding With Adam.
This is simply as far as I've made it up to this point in my project. I will continue to add more. 
I'm currently working on additional functionality and personalizing the code so that it's not simply 
a code along done by watching one single tutorial.
I'm working on adding a menu next and hopefully some buttons on the menu.
After that I'd like to add powerups if time allows it.
